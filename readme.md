## Introduction
The **Public Font Curation** (PFC) offers a simple collection of free fonts for web developers, designers, and other digital artists to use in their projects.

## Why use PFC?
PFC was born out of the need for easy-to-select fonts without the hassle of searching through hundreds of potential fonts.

As the curation grows more fonts will be available to choose from. [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is the main source from which PFC draws from, but work is being done to include alternate sources found across the interwebs.

Every font listed on PFC are **third-party fonts** that fall under an open-source license. This means that they are generally listed as free to use for both commercial and personal use. 

> DISCLAIMER: Always read the license carefully. Not all free fonts allow for commercial use and some may require attribution.
